# RFM-analysis

I successfully applied RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to business data that I sourced from Kaggle. This involved systematically evaluating customer purchase behavior and segmenting the data based on the recency, frequency, and monetary value of transactions to better understand customer segments and tailor marketing strategies to enhance customer retention and increase sales.
